# evolutionary_genomics_course
Welcome to the course "Evolutionary Genomics"

This course, taught by Daly Noll, Gabriela Narv√°ez and Lucila Morales, was designed to introduce students to key bioinformatics concepts and tools used in evolutionary genomics, with a main focus on the analysis of genetic data. Here we include all the files we used during the course in case you want to redo something at home.
