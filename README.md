# evolutionary_genomics_course
__Welcome to the course "Evolutionary Genomics"__

This course, taught by Daly Noll, Gabriela Narv√°ez, and Lucila Morales, is designed to introduce students to key bioinformatics concepts and tools used in evolutionary genomics, with a primary focus on the analysis of genetic data. Here, we include all the files used during the course in case you want to redo any of the exercises at home.

__DAY 1__

Fundamentals and Techniques of Short Read Preprocessing and Mapping:
Introduction to read preprocessing
Sequence mapping
Masking duplicates and repetitive regions
Generation of BAM, VCF, and FASTA files
Brief introduction to Indel detection
