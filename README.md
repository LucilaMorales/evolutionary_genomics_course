# evolutionary_genomics_course
Welcome to the course "Evolutionary Genomics"

This course, taught by Daly Noll, Gabriela Narv√°ez, and Lucila Morales, is designed to introduce students to key bioinformatics concepts and tools used in evolutionary genomics, with a primary focus on the analysis of genetic data. Here, we include all the files used during the course in case you want to redo any of the exercises at home.
