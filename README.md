# evolutionary_genomics_course
Welcome to the course "Evolutionary Genomics"

This course, taught by Daly Noll, Gabriela Narv√°ez, and Lucila Morales, is designed to introduce students to key bioinformatics concepts and tools used in evolutionary genomics, with a primary focus on the analysis of genetic data. Here, we include all the files used during the course in case you want to redo any of the exercises at home.

DAY 1
#Fundamentals and Techniques of Short Read Preprocessing and Mapping:
##Introduction to read preprocessing
###Sequence mapping
###Masking duplicates and repetitive regions
###Generation of BAM, VCF, and FASTA files
###Brief introduction to Indel detection
